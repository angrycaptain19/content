- Added two new unit test that deal with duplication of indicators in the ***fetch-indicators*** command. 
- Fixed an issue where the **services** parameter was incorrectly passed to three existing unit tests.
- Improved implementation of reading the outputs of the ***fetch-indicators*** command's generator, which should improve the runtime of the fetch.
